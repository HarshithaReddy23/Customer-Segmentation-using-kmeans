# Customer-Segmentation-using-kmeans

This is a data mining project using kmeans clustering with the use of 3 optimal clusters

Specify the cluster’s number that we are going to create.
An object as initial cluster or mean is used.
The algorithm uses K objects at random from the dataset.
Euclidean Distance between object and centroid is observed.
Through calculation K-clusters update the centroid and p is the number of
variables in the observations in k-th cluster.
Iterative minimization technique is used to sum up the squares.
With the default value in the R software, we are going to use the maximum
iterations.

Here we are going to Determine the Optimal Clusters so we need the three popular
methods:-
 Elbow method
 Silhouette method
 Gap Static
In the proposed system we are going to implement these K-means clustering and
Optimal clustering techniques in the R software. Our system is going to show the
proper customer segmentation in the shopping mall and we are going to get proper
information regarding the customers so that we can plan the mall according to
them.
MALL_CUSTOMERS.CSV DATASET ATTRIBUTES INFORMATION:
Here we have the following features:
1. Customer-ID: The unique ID given to a customer
2. Gender: Gender of the customer
3. Age: The age of the customer
4. Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer
5. Spending Score: The score (out of 100) given to a customer by the mall
authorities, based on the money spent and the behaviour of the customer
